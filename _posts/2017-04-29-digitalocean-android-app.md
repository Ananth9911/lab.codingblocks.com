**DigitalOceanApp** is an Android App that brings the Digital Ocean admin
console to your mobile.

It was originally built at a DigitalOcean Hackathon.

The major functionalities it aims to solve are -
 - User logs in with Digital Ocean Account
 - User can see his droplets
 - User can **create** new droplets
 - User can **manage** existing droplets (Check DigitalOcean `actions` API for everything that is possible)
