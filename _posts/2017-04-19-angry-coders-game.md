This is a game similar to Angry Birds, with a catch. You don't drag the bird
and release with your mouse. What you do is, you write functions to calculate
the angle and velocity of departure of the bird, based on the height and
distance of the target.

Are your _projectile motion_ and coding skills up for the game ?
