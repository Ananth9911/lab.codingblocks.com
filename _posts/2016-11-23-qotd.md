The 'Question of the Day' webapp initially should only fulfill the purpose of 
a admin console. Later on it should also evolve client functionality - 
i.e. people should be able get a new question every day and solve them. 

### User Flow
The user flow of the webapp is as follows - 

 - User can login/proceed as guest
     - If proceed as guest  
       -  Can see list of questions  
     - If logged in
       -  Can see list of questions
       - If user is administrator
         - Can edit questions
         - Can delete questions
         - Can add new questions
         - Can view users
         - Enable the role administrator on other users
