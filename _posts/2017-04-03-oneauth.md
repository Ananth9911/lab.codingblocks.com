**Oneauth** is a _Single Sign On_ system. An use case, as is at _**Coding Blocks**_ is that
when there are multiple apps/websites, like <http://hackerblocks.com> and
<http://students.codingblocks.com>, we would prefer to do user-management on a single
server, and use the same accounts on all the servers.
This is similar to what large websites like **Google** or **Microsoft** do.
You use the same Google account for Gmail, Youtube, G+,  Chrome and all other Google Services.

We can see **oneauth** deployed and life in action on <http://account.codingblocks.com>

**oneauth** has both -
 - an Oauth consumption interface, so users can login with Facebook/Twitter/Google
 - an Oauth serving interface to all CodingBlocks apps/clients can use it to login.
