A portal where students and companies can be connected with each other
for prospective jobs and/or internships.

There are two user stories we are trying to build here -

#### From the students perspective

1. Signup on the platform
2. Create profile page
3. Add CV/Resume to profile page
4. Add links to projects and papers
5. System generate "tags" for the student's profile based on strengths and experiences
6. Student can browse companies
7. Student can search openings based on filters like required skills

#### From the company representative perspective

1. Signup on the platform
2. Create company profile page
3. Create openings. Each opening is a separate entity
4. Add required skill sets for each opening
5. Browse students
6. Search students based on filters like skill sets, experience etc
