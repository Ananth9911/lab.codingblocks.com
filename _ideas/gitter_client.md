A gitter client for android with added functionality using existing gitter API
as current one sucks.

There will be support for:
- emojis
- more animations
- editing the text
- all other features of the current android app

The current one (gitter android app) is not opensoirce and is widely used by
pen source organizations, hence this will come handy.
